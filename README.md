Authors: Matthew Carroll & Tom Benton

This repository contains some add on functions for analysis of PISA data. 
The functions draw heavily upon code written from  the existing R package *intsvy* by Caro and Biecek (2017).

Rather than a full R package, this repository simply contains the code for the functions, and some documentation written in markdown 
including example R scripts showing how to use them.
